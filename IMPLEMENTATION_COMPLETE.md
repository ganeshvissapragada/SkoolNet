- **PostgreSQL for Scholarships**: Complex eligibility logic, deadline management, admin-created structured data with relationships
- **MongoDB for Attendance/Marks**: High-volume daily records, flexible schema for different assessment types

### Performance Optimizations:
- Indexed foreign keys in PTM and Scholarship tables
- Efficient queries with proper includes/joins
- Client-side eligibility filtering for responsive UX
- Lazy loading of scholarship details

### Security Features:
- JWT-based authentication for all endpoints
- Role-based access control (admin, teacher, parent, student)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protected routes with middleware
